I am a master student in Electronic Engineering at Northwestern University now. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering in 2019 at Beihang University(Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) with Honors from Shenyuan Honors College. 

### More Information

Currently, my research interests include Social Network Analysis, Big Data and Internet of Things(IoT). In order to find a SDE job, however, I will also do some projects related to web/app development in the future.

As for languages I can speak, my mother language is Chinese mandarin. Since I am studying in America, I also can speak English, though it's not as good as I expected. I am trying to improve my oral English ability. Besides, I could speak a little bit Korea, Japanese, Russian and a tiny bit Uighur language.

I am a master student in Electronic Engineering at Northwestern University now. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering in 2019 at Beihang University(Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) with Honors from Shenyuan Honors College. 

### More Information

Currently, my research interests include Social Network Analysis, Big Data and Internet of Things(IoT). To order to find a SDE job, however, I will also do some projects related to web/app development in the future.

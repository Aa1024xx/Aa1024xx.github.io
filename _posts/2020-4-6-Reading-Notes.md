## Reading: Don't make me think, A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Chapters 1 and 2 ##

### Chapter 1. Don't make me think! ###

##### Reading Notes #####
The first law of usability is *Don't make users think*, which means to make things self-evident or at least self-explanatory.

In this chapter, the author lists some things that make users "think" : <br/>
1. why did they give it that name? 
-- *Web copy often trades off between professionalism and ease of use*
2. can this button be clicked? 
-- *the button needs to explicitly show the user whether it can be clicked*
3. where am I? 
-- *clear navigation*
4. where do I start? 
-- *the entrance should be clear*
5. where did they put XX? 
-- *Important features should be obvious*
6. what is the most important thing about this page? 
-- *visual center of gravity*

When we visit the Web, each question mark adds to our cognitive load. An experienced designer will notice everything on the web that makes you think. The author also provides another example of booking a flight to prove this point. According to the example, the most important thing, a designer should keep in mind, is to eliminate question marks ballooning in users' mind. The effect should be that users get what it is and how to use it without having to think about it. As designers, if we can't make something self-evident, we need to make it self-explanatory at least.

Although people often site <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Internet, the competition is always just one click away, 
so if you frustrate users they will head somewhere else. <br/>
Actually, people sometimes stick to their initial choice. If the website or the app is unique in market or if users' sunk cost
is big enough, this circumstance will appear. It can explain why many apps encourage premium account.

##### Reading Summary #####
1. Don't make users spend too much time or energy to think
2. The design should make users able to see the content at a glance and know how to use it
3. The page content should be obvious, not obscure
4. do not put everything on the interface, to have a primary and secondary, so as to let the user intuitively feel what the page want to do

### Chapter 2. How we really use the Web ###

##### Reading Notes #####

If we want to design effective web pages, we need to accept these 3 fact:

1. We don't read pages, we scan them.
The reason of it:<br/>
(a) We're usually on a mission.<br/>
(b) We know we don't need to read everything.<br/>
(c) Scanning is a basic kill as we read.<br/>
General attention is directed to words and phrases that have the following characteristics:<br/>
(a) the task at hand<br/>
(b) current or ongoing personal interests<br/>
(c) trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems<br/>

2. We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.
The reason of it:<br/>
(a) We're usually in a hurry.<br/>
(b) There is not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.<br/>
(c) Weighing options may not improve our chances.<br/>
(d) Guessing is more fun.<br/>

3. We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.
The reason of it:<br/>
(a) It is not important to us.<br/>
(b) If we find something that works, we stick to it.<br/>
The advantages of making users "get it":<br/>
(a) There’s a much better chance that they’ll find what they’re looking for, which is good for them and for you.<br/>
(b) There’s a better chance that they’ll understand the full range of what your site has to offer—not just the parts that they stumble across.<br/>
(c) You have a better chance of steering them to the parts of your site that you want them to see.<br/>
(d) They’ll feel smarter and more in control when they’re using your site, which will bring them back.<br/>

##### Reading Summary #####
1. When browsing the web, users will choose what they see at first sight, which is interesting and highly recognizable.

2. Users do not read the web page word by word, but scan and browse, and do not spend too much time reading the web page. If users see something they're interested or something recognizable, they will click it.

3, Users while using the web, will not consider how it works, but whether it is easy to use, whether it is easy to understand , all what they want is to get their needs more easily.

4, For a designer, one important point is to let users easily understand your design. It doesn't have to be very complicated.
